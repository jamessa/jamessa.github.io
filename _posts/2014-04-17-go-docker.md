#Lightweight Container

Linux Containers **LXC**

* Kernel namespaces (ipc, uts, mount, pid, network and user)
* Chroots (using pivot_root)
* Kernel capabilities
* Control groups (cgroups)

^ The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible as a standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.

##PID namespaces in the 2.6.24 kernel

```c
struct upid {
    int nr;					      /* moved from struct pid */
    struct pid_namespace *ns;	  /* the namespace this value is visible in */
    struct hlist_node pid_chain;  /* moved from struct pid */
};

struct pid {
    atomic_t count;
    struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX];
    struct rcu_head rcu;
    int level;				/* the number of upids */
    struct upid numbers[0];
};
```

#[Go-LXC](https://github.com/lxc/go-lxc)
Go Bindings for LXC

in `lxc.c`

```c
pid_t go_lxc_init_pid(struct lxc_container *c) {
	return c->init_pid(c);
}

```

#Creating an lxc container in Go
```go
func main() {
	c, err := lxc.NewContainer(name, lxcpath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("ERROR: %s\n", err.Error())
	}
	defer lxc.PutContainer(c)

	log.Printf("Creating container...\n")
	c.SetVerbosity(lxc.Verbose)

	if os.Geteuid() != 0 {
		if err := c.CreateAsUser(distro, release, arch); err != nil {
			log.Printf("ERROR: %s\n", err.Error())
		}
	} else {
		if err := c.Create(template, "-a", arch, "-r", release); err != nil {
			log.Printf("ERROR: %s\n", err.Error())

##Most of the appeal for me is not the features that Go has, but rather the features that have been intentionally left out.

#Why Go?

1. Static compilation
2. Netural
3. It has what we need
4. Full development environment
5. Multi-arch build

[Jérôme Petazzoni, Docker and Go: why did we decide to write Docker in Go?](http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go)

^ easy to install, deploy
^ not C++, Python, Ruby, Java
^ asynchronous primitives, 
^ doc, get ,fmt, test run
^ _linux, _darwin
