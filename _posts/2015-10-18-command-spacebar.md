#Who get the Command-Spacebar?

In OSX keyboard layout, the most precious shortcut is Command-Spacebar which is for Spotlight by default. However, if you're like me needs alternative input source, sometimes it's annoying. Before El Capitan, Spotlight shortcut will switch to Control-Space once you add more then one input method. Yes, that make sense, the chances for normal user to use Spotlight is way lower then switching input method.

But as an more advanced user, Spotlight and input source switch are equally important since Spotlight provides and command line like interface to many things which boost my productivity (which is a rare resource.) and my daily communication involves frequent switch between input sources for typing in Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and English.

If it's equally important, let's make it even. Both of them uses Command+Spacebar the most ergonomic keyboard shortcut. Here's how it's done.

1. In Settings->Keyboard->Shortcut makes sure

Spotlight is set to Command-Spacebar
Last Input Source is set to Control-Spacebar

2. In Seil, remap Command_R as Control_R

3. Now you can

Spotlight with Left Command+Spacebar
Last Input Source with Right Command+Spacebar

Let's call the whole thing off. Enjoy typing.
